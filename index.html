                    <p>Hi! I'm Erik Malmstrom-Partridge, a 17 year old high school student from mid-Michigan. I specialize in Java programming, in particular statistical analysis and artificial intelligence, I'm a history buff, and I am passionate about the aviation industry. This summer I am taking Shakespeare's Ten Best plays along with Dynamic Web Applications.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm taking this course to open my horizons. I want to try something new, and I already program as a hobby, so I felt like this would be an interesting course for me to take.</li>
                        <li>I started looking into HTML at age 9, which lasted for a short period of time, but recently I've become more interested in how HTML and Java can work together. I also have some familiarity with HTML from a few Wordpress sites I've built. CSS-wise I'm less strong, most of my experience coming from building JavaFX applications.</li>
                        <li>My previous experience with programming comes with writing Java as a hobby, and taking AP Computer Science. I've also done a bit of C++, Python, PHP, and I've tried my hand C, but in the end, Java just runs through my veins.</li>
                        <li>I have limited experience with PHP, in May I helped out a bit with a site using Laravel, and I've done the codecademy PHP course but for the most part, I'm a PHP rookie, in the sense that I know the syntax, but I've never successfully applied it in a large scale.</li>
                        <li>I'm pretty flexible on which operating system I use. For the sake of this I'll say Mac OS X Mavericks, as I use it about 65% of the time, but I also have Windows 8.1 installed on my laptop, and I have a VPS running Debian.</li>
                        <li>Think that's it!</li>
